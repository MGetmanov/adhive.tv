The market has been plagued by various issues related to correct identification and placement of content. The main problem at the moment is video and photo file recognition from various internet sources without losing data components.

The solution in this regard is to ensure the performance and fault tolerance of recognition functions. To solve the issue and bring high quality content to the market, AdHive has developed a distributed multi-layered AI cluster architecture. The development of the AI cluster ensures the performance of the recognition functions and guarantees its fault tolerance.
  
The diagram below illustrates the structure and components of the architecture.

AdHive has developed a distributed multi-layered AI cluster architecture. The development of an AI cluster ensures the performance of recognition functions and guarantees high fault tolerance. The diagram below illustrates the structure and components of the architecture.

Let us look through the components of the AI ​​cluster architecture and briefly examine the functions each block is responsible for.
